cvc2git

A tool to pull a conary package:source into a git repository.

That's the only function supported. No support for 'cvc update' for now.

Usage
------
cvc2git.py <package-fullversion> [<directory>]

    <package-fullversion>
        Package name with label,  as returned by '$ conary q --full-versions <pkg>:source'

    <directory>
        The name of a new directory to clone into. If not specified, the package name is used.

------
Got quite stuck on the hg-cvc tool, so I started this very-poor-behaving one.
