cvc2git

A tool to pull a conary package:source into a git repository.

That's the only function supported. No support for 'cvc update' for now.

Usage
------
cvc2git.py <package-fullversion> [<directory>]

    <package-fullversion>
        Package name with label,  as returned by
        '$ conary q --full-versions <pkg>:source'

    <directory>
        The name of a new directory to clone into. If not specified, the
        package name is used.

Implementation
--------------
Got quite stuck on the hg-cvc tool, so I started this very-poor-behaving one.

Basically, it works by checking out each revision of the package (cvc update
<revision>), commit it to git (git add; git commit), checking out the next
revision, on and on.

That's each and every revision. Plus the bad speed of cvc, so this is very slow.

Example
-------
$ python cvc2git.py monodevelop=foresight.rpath.org@fl:2-devel

This will checkout monodevelop:source and put it in the ./monodevelop
directory. It's a normal git repository and you can run normal git commands
there.

$ python cvc2git.py avr-binutils=/jesse.rpath.org@fl:2-devel test

This will checkout avr-binutils from my personal repository into ./test.
